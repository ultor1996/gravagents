      "raw_llm_response": "INTEGRATION ANALYSIS:\nBoth tasks are tightly coupled: Task 1 downloads and loads the GW150914 strain data for Hanford (H1) and Livingston (L1) detectors, and Task 2 visualizes this data as strain vs. time. The main dependency is that Task 2 requires the `strain_data` dictionary and the `gps_center` variable produced in Task 1.\n\nIntegration steps:\n- Consolidate all imports at the top, removing duplicates (`numpy` is imported in both tasks).\n- Ensure that `strain_data` and `gps_center` are available for the plotting section.\n- Add robust error handling for both data download and plotting.\n- Add progress print statements for user feedback.\n- Save the plot as a PNG file in addition to displaying it, for reproducibility.\n- Ensure the script is ready to run as a standalone file.\n\nNo file persistence is needed for intermediate data, as the data is small and held in memory. The script will be linear, with clear section headers and progress output.\n\nINTEGRATED SCRIPT:\n```python\n# =========================\n# GW150914 Strain Data Download and Visualization\n# =========================\n\n# ---- Imports ----\nfrom pycbc.catalog import Merger\nfrom pycbc.frame import query_and_read_frame\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport sys\n\n# ---- Parameters ----\nEVENT_NAME = \"GW150914\"\nDETECTORS = ['H1', 'L1']\nDURATION = 4  # seconds\nGPS_CENTER = 1126259462\nSTART_TIME = GPS_CENTER - DURATION // 2\nEND_TIME = GPS_CENTER + DURATION // 2\nPLOT_FILENAME = \"GW150914_strain_vs_time.png\"\n\n# ---- Task 1: Download and Load Strain Data ----\nprint(\"=\"*60)\nprint(f\"Step 1: Downloading strain data for {EVENT_NAME} from LOSC\")\nprint(\"=\"*60)\n\nstrain_data = {}\n\ntry:\n    print(\"Querying event information from PyCBC catalog...\")\n    event = Merger(EVENT_NAME)\n    print(f\"Event found: {event.event}\")\n\n    for det in DETECTORS:\n        print(f\"Downloading strain data for detector {det}...\")\n        # Channel name is the same as detector\n        try:\n            strain = query_and_read_frame(\n                det,\n                det,  # Channel name is 'H1' or 'L1'\n                START_TIME,\n                END_TIME\n            )\n            strain_data[det] = strain\n            print(f\"  - {det}: Loaded {strain.duration} seconds at {strain.sample_rate} Hz\")\n        except Exception as det_e:\n            print(f\"  - Error loading data for {det}: {det_e}\")\n\n    if not strain_data:\n        print(\"No strain data was loaded for any detector.
